# Heart-Disease-Prediction
Heart Disease Prediction Model with Flask
Project Overview
This project is a machine learning-based web application designed to predict the likelihood of heart disease using patient data. It incorporates three algorithms—KNN, Decision Trees, and Logistic Regression—along with exploratory data analysis (EDA) to provide insights and predictions. The model is deployed using a Flask framework, offering an interactive interface for users to input data and receive predictions.
